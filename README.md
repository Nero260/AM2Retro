# AM2R-Community-Updates

# What is this?
The source code for the AM2R Community Updates 1.5.x branch, free of copyrighted assets and trademarks. If you have not played the AM2R Community Updates before, this will be of no use to you!

This source code is based on AM2Rrc by YellowAfterlife. It could be considered a fork.

If you are looking for a playable build of the mod, please download the AM2RLauncher and the latest version on the Release Page. After that you can add it in AM2RLauncher's mod settings.

# Copyright clarifications
This source code does not contain any copyrighted assets or trademarks - in fact, it does not contain any assets at all, just like the AM2Rrc repository.

Assets must be extracted from your copy of the AM2R Community Updates using GMXDataSync in order to compile this project properly.

Furthermore, there are two paid shader assets included in the Community Updates: Pixelated Pope's Retro Palette Swapper and PixHammer's GameBoy Shader. We do not curently have permission to distribute either of these assets, so they are excluded from this repository. You will need to replace them with default shader code in order for the project to compile.

Finally, we have excluded the datafiles and changelog from this repository to further enforce the removal of trademarks.
